# Post-transcriptional reprogramming by thousands of mRNA untranslated regions in trypanosomes
we describe the UTR sequences that control gene expression in the context of a constitutively transcribed genome
and conclude that thousands of UTRs post-transcriptionally reprogram gene expression profiles in trypanosomes.

## Code Repository
We deposited and divided in subsection the code used for the data analysis
